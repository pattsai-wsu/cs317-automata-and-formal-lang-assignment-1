Issue: I ran into an issue testing with the sample text in blackboard. My filehandler didn't work.

UPDATE: Found that the blackboard sample file was made on a mac and it uses a \r newline character (not the \n new line character linux uses)
        Just wanted to let you all know in case others are having issues.

List of files:
  1. addNfa.c           // adds a new linked list node for each NFA
  2. addTrans.c         // adds a new linked list node for each transition
  3. addTransEnd.c      // adds an ending linked list node for the or and star operations 
  4. fileHandler.c      // ingests the contents of a file and formats each line into a string
  5. header.h           // contains all the include structure and function protyping data 
  6. main.c             // main code for reading the strings
  7. Makefile           // compiles the program files
  8. nfaInit.c          // creates a sentinel node for the nfa linked list
  9. opAnd.c            // code for the AND operation
  10. opOr.c            // code for the OR operation
  11. opStar.c          // code for the * operation
  12. pop.c             // pops from the stack
  13. print.c           // prints the contents of each NFA
  14. push.c            // pushes to the stack
  15. README            // the file you are reading right now
  16. readTop.c         // reads the top of the stack 
  17. transitionInit.c  // creates the sentinel node for the transitions linked list
  18. testFileA.txt     // I had trouble with the sample text provided on blackboard
  19. testFile.txt      // original blackboard sample, should work now
